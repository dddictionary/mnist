# MNIST 

This was my first ever Machine Learning model. 

I watched a tutorial on youtube, shoutout to [NeuralNine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bte8Er0QhDg) on YouTube.

You can clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dddictionary/mnist.git
```

You can create a new python virtual environment on Linux using:
```bash
python -m venv mnist
source ./mnist/bin/activate
```
and download the required packages through:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can add more digits to the `digits` folder and then run `main.py` using:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will read all the images, classify them, print to the console, and display a plot of the image itself.

Machine Learning is very fun!
